1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

- react solves the issue with the DOM, reloading the page changes is hard on the computer so with Reacts virtual DOM it can solve that issue without even reloading.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

- To think in react I think it means to always know what the console is telling you and what errors appear what I learned so far is that props and state are a huge part of react and knowing when you have access to that state at all times is something you need to know.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

- class components are written differently and have access to the state, while regular functional components have access to the props and the state as well but cant have their own state.

1.  Describe state.

- What I believe what state is the current value of an object, like if you what to change a value of a key already set in state you will have to replace that whole state with a new once + the change you made. since state is immutable.

1.  Describe props.

- Props are which past down to other components from the state, so if the state has a name in it, and once its past down to another component now that component has access to it as a prop.
